# Forum

## Network Firewalling
We are back to the public web. People are being assaulted. Graham feels that we should restrict certain ports from external access. We feel that we should discuss this at a later time (Saturday @ 6:00pm).

## COSI Storage
Adam notes that we are leaving more items in COSI. Alan suggested allowing people to move objects if they are in the way for extended periods of time. Many agree with such.
Additionally, a lost and found will be constructed to move things to.

## Twitch Plays Turtlebot
TO BE FILLED LATER

## Printing in COSI
We used to have a print balance. Ben believes we should have a balance. He wants large prints to go through the directors. Ben also feels that we should have a 100 page limit.

## Pi Day Activity
We need to plan for Pi Day. The activity needs to be mathy and computery. It will be for middle schoolers. Graham has "volunteered" to plan for it.
