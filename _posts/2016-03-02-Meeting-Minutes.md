# Forum

## Distributed Data Center
We need to decide if we should put the distributed data center project in our server room. Jared is 
skeptical about storing it. Fulton and Kyle are fine with it. Forum as a whole is okay with storing 
it for the next year (with option of extension). The directors will contact the researcher soon.

## Pi Day
Alan wanted someone to talk about what COSI will do for Pi Day. The event is next Wednesday from 4pm 
to 5pm. We don't seem to have anyone who will be able to attend.

## Faculty Involvement
Fulton and Ben would like more faculty to become involved in the labs. They want to draft an email 
to the faculty. The labs feel it would be a pretty good idea. Prof. Liu appears to be interesting in 
participating more in the labs (i.e. lightning talks).
