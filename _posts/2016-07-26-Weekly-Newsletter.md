Morning all,

After this week, the majority of the people that have been up at Clarkson for the summer will be leaving for a month. That said, I have a few topics that I am going to touch while we're still here.

First with Mirror. We've been working on becoming official mirrors for more distributions, and as of this last week, we are now an official mirror for Manjaro Linux, a fork of Arch Linux. Now, 9 out of the 18 Linux distros we host are now official mirrors and we plan on reaching out to the remaining nine in the upcoming weeks. As well, I've been working on doing some analysis of the network traffic we've been getting on Mirror, and within the last 4 days alone, we've logged over 25k unique ip addresses. I am planning on doing some more analysis on the logs that are collected and will be updating the stats page on Mirror's site with more content as we gain it.

Next with The-Internet, we are now the #1 contributor for the project. As of today we have over 23TB of data backed up with 11TB of remaining space still available to grow, and Bobby has found a graph of the last month of progress we've helped with. The graph is attached at the end of this email.

Finally, I would like to say good luck to everyone participating in the SURE Conference this Thursday, including many cosinaughts including, Bobby Newman, Sam Heater, Abigail Matthews, and David Skufca.

Have a nice week,
Benjamin
