# Forum

##3D Printer Fillament
Graham wanted to get more. We decided that we are good for this semester.

## Tape
Bobby requested more tape for the 3d printer. Alan requested additional tapes. We decided to get painter's tape for the printer.

## Robots
Satar is leaving next semester; we get his robots. Michael F. is meeting with Satar on Friday to transfer the hardware to COSI. Michael will also set up the robots over the break; he will prepare resources on docs as well as a workshop. He requested a workspace for the robots (a wireless machine). We will revisit deciding on a workspace later. We debated where to store the Husky. We will likely keep the Husky in COSI over the break and look into alternate housing (a closet near the lecture halls was popular). We discussed access to the robots and have agreed that access will be more limited than our other resources. 

## Server Room Lock
Talked a bit about it. Will revisit at end of spring 2016 semester.

## Bylaws
We talked a bit about the bylaws and continued into the afterslot.
