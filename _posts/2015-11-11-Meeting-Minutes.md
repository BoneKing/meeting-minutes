# Forum

## Keys
Keys for the server room will be transfered within upcoming weeks

## COSI Subdomain
The cosi subdomain should be delegated to us as of the end of the night.

## Switches
The switches have arrived and are set up. They will be installed in the
server room very soon. Graham discussed the design of the new networking in
the labs.

## Tor Exit Node & 146/24 Subnet
We'll be setting up on a Tor Exit Node in the future. The node will be put on
a new untrusted subnet (146/24) and will only be able to talk to other things
on the internet and not on any of our services.

## Security Cam
The camera was moved to now look around the area surrounding the labs.

## Door Access Control
A door access system for the server room would possibly cost about $1200. The
labs are interested in this idea, but we shall wait until the end of the year
due to the large percentage of the budget.

## LinkedIn
Sam is interested in wanting to have a LinkedIn page for the Labs.

## COSI Volunteering Initiative
Sam is interested in wanting to go to local public schools and talk about coding and
FOSS.
