## Meeting Minutes
Fulton will take over meeting minutes next semester.

## Mirror Purchase
We've placed the order for mirror. Parts should be arriving soon.

## Moving Services
Jared wants to change the Distance server to something else (i.e. a VM Host)... Jeanna feels that we 
should keep using Distance to host Big Blue Button. Ben also agrees. No one else has strong 
oppinions.

Jared also wants to know how we will reconfigure where exising VMs are located... We will defer to a 
later meeting.

## Brag List
Fulton has started compiling the brag list. Contact him for anything you want added.

## Arch Linux Lab Build
Jared wants to use Arch for the lab build. He feels that using Arch will fix the issues with NFS. 
Bobby agrees with him. Jared plans on creating a test machine. Fulton is okay with it. No one 
objects.

## OIT RAID Array
Jared wants to know where the RAID array should be stored. Bobby wants to place the array on top of 
the Cisco routers.
