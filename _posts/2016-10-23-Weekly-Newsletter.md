Afternoon,

Yesterday, the Clarkson ACM chapter held the 2016-2017 ACM-ICPC in the ITL. There were 27 students from St. Lawrence University,
Middlebury College, Clark University, and Clarkson University. Two Clarkson students and COSI members, Graham Northup and Alex Macri
finished in 2nd place after a close race near the end of the competition.

Upcoming This week, I am planning on holding the first meeting for the COSI Webdev team. I have already met with people who have expressed
interest and I want to figure out when would be best for us to meet. For those interested, please fill out this When2Meet Form
so I can plan a time for us to begin working.

As usual, the COSI Meeting is going to be held this Wednesday. If you missed last week, here is the [Meeting Minutes](https://cosi-lab.github.io/meeting-minutes/minutes/2016/10/19/Meeting-Minutes.html).

Have a good week!
Benjamin
