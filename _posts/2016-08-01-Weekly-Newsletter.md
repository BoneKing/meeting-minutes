Evening all,

I don't have much to comment on, but I do have a few topics. First of all, As
of last week, the lab builds for the 2016-2017 year were completed and cloned
down to the machines. Next, After discussing our idea of intro workshops with
Jeanna, she suggested the idea of a COSI VM, where students running Windows
or MacOS can easily obtain a similar workflow of that of the lab builds by
using a VirtualBox VM. I'm planning on working on this image in the coming weeks
and having it available on one of our websites before classes begin. Finally,
I looked at our mirror logs and we had a jump to 50k unique ip's tracked over
the week, particularly with a high amount of traffic on July 28th. Hopefully by
next week I can get the initial setup for these statistics onto Mirror's website.

Have a good week,
Benjamin
