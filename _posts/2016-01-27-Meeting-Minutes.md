## Monitor Burn-In
Graham thought he saw monitors burned in. They weren't actually burned. The monitors are however poor quality. Graham wants to get new ones. Alan wants us to try our old monitors.

## Can Returns
Graham wants to return our used soda cans. We may not have enough room to do so. We decided to not bother.

## Electric Lock Box
We worry that our master passwords may be at risk. The current lockbox has a couple security flaws. Various people want a new lockbox. If we get one, we would want to pay for a good one. We all seem to want to buy one. Someone will spec a good box.
