Evening,

Within the last hour, I pushed a new update to Talks, the web app used to manage
our weekly meetings. Before, if someone made a new entry or edited an existing one,
the change would occur locally and in the database, but not on other clients as well.
Now in Talks 2.2 with the help of WebSockets, any post to the server will now
update on all clients.

In other news, We are now syncing the [ubuntu-ports](http://mirror.clarkson.edu/ubuntu-ports/)
repo on mirror, which includes the port of Ubuntu for ARM devices. As well, we
are now an official mirror for CentOS.

We're two weeks away from the first week of classes, so things are going to pick
up as it gets closer to that time, but in the meantime, enjoy the remainder of
the summer.
