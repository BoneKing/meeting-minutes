Evening all,

As of 10 years ago this summer, the current layout of the two rooms of COSI and the ITL were created. Since then, a huge cast of people have come and gone through the labs with different interests and expertise, but still held to the foundations of what makes us COSI. With that, I think it would be nice to have a website to be able to view the history of COSI throughout the years. Alan Beadle had passed on to me a COSI time capsule containing mainly pictures of COSI events through the years.

With this, I would like to call all current and past cosinaughts to share with us any COSI history you have. Whether it be any projects that existed in the labs when you were around, or any pictures that were taken through the years while you were here. The more content we can get, the more clearer we can see how the labs have changed across the past two decades.

I will slowly be creating the site over the rest of the summer and into the fall semester with content that I have and I highly encourage people to help out with the project as well. Please reply to this email if you have any content you can remember.

Night,
Benjamin
