Evening everyone,

For some things coming up this week, COSI will be hosting Lockheed Martin this Wednesday. They'll be giving a
talk after the normal COSI meeting @ 8:30pm in the ITL.

Also, COSI Webdev kicked off this past Friday. We mainly talked about what I want to do with the project. For
everyone who I invited to the COSI-Lab GitHub organization, you should have an email about it in your inbox.
As well, I am adding another when2meet for this upcoming week's meeting.
I am thinking of having a 1-2hour session to go over a short workshop on some Github workflow features as well as
some brainstorming for some projects that were discussed as well.

See everyone Wednesday!
Benjamin
