## 3D Printer Fans
Bobby says that Kyle has noticed the fan on the 3d printer. $20 will get four fans. No one objects.

hardware with an additional SAS cable. This is the cheapest option. They'll look into other options 
should the cable option fail. Forum approves.

## rj45 Emergency Ziltoid Switch
Jared wants to get an ethernet switch so that we can easily switch the network if ziltiod dies at
