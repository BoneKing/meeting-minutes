(This was previously sent to the cslabannounce list, but I am going to be posting it at both places for more reach)

Greetings,

Starting this week, I'll be sending out a weekly newsletter on things that are
going on in COSI. Even though we're in the middle of summer, there are still
projects going on in the labs. Currently I would like to discuss two of them:
Mirror and The-Internet.

As of this week, I'm proud to say that Mirror has transferred over 20TB since
its launch back in April. We have grown to host 19 distributions as well as 10
other software packages on mirror and we plan on continuing to grow our collection
through the rest of the year. We are also beginning to start reaching out to many
of these distributions to become official mirrors which will increase our presence
even more. To see what is on mirror, visit [mirror.clarkson.edu](http://mirror.clarkson.edu)

Over the past few weeks, we have started a new service in the labs that focuses
on backing up parts of the Internet Archive as part of the
[IA.BAK project](http://iabak.archiveteam.org/) (we're listed as newmanre in the
top 25 contributors list, which is Bobby Newman's email who is managing this
project). We've dubbed the server running this "The-Internet", which re-purposes
the old Mirror server, and we've connected it to the storage array that was
donated to the labs from OIT to be able offer IA.BAK over 34TB of usable storage
after putting the drives in RAID. So far, we have about 7TB backed up from several
collections and are still downloading more at this moment.

There are plenty of other projects that are slowly starting and will be discussed
in upcoming weeks, but for now, have a good 4th of July weekend.

Talk to everyone next week,
Benjamin
