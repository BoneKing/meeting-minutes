# Forum

## ITL 48 Port Switch
Jared is suggesting 2 48-port switches, a switch being used in the itl is dying,
but we have some other switches laying about that were switched out for the managed
switches. We'll look into getting new ones when we are getting low on spare switches.

## Lab HVAC
Kyle suggested that we could talk to facilities in the future to fix the airflow in
COSI.

## Lab Cleanliness
There has been fairly minimal table space, so Jared suggested to do some cleaning
and Michael suggested that it would be a good idea to be courteous about the lab space.

## VM Host Plans
Jared discussed how we should manage our VM infrastructure as we make the new VM Host.
If anyone is interested, we're building the new VM host on Saturday. An email will be sent
out with the time.

## Metapod Switch
We discussed that FreeBSD isn't feasible for our setting, so we are planning on switching
our Storage / NFS server over to Debian. No one had any issues with it.

## Gitlab Migration
Jared discussed that Gitlab has troubles being run as VM, so he suggested moving it to Distance.
No one opposed as well.

## Logic Analyzer
Graham suggested getting a logic Analyzer. It's been suggested to wait till the end of the year
if we have any remaining budget since no one really had any particular use cases for it.

of 3D printing.

## How to be an expert
Kyle showed us a video on being an "expert", as people in
COSI are experts in many different things and will eventually
have to communicate with others that aren't experts in our field. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg)
