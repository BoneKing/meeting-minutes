Evening all.

With the semester only 7 weeks away, many of us are preparing for the upcoming
year. One project I am helping contribute to that will ease management of our
services is integration of the Ansible platform into our workflow. Ansible is a
configuration management platform which uses SSH to control and manage remote
hosts. Our first use of it in the labs allows us to install our LDAP/Kerberos
authentication workflow onto a machine with only a single command. You can find
more information about Ansible at https://www.ansible.com/

Another upcoming project in the labs is a series of FOSS intro workshops. Both
Michael and I are planning on hosting a few workshops on main tools like Version
Control with Git, Intro to the command line, and text editors spanning from Vim
to Atom. If there is anyone who has a topic that they would like to share or wish
there would be a workshop on, feel free to contact me about it.

For some misc. information, we're mirroring Slitaz Linux on Mirror once again.
As well, we have jumped to the #2 spot in the IA.BAK project with about 15TB of
backups stored.

Have a good week!

Benjamin
