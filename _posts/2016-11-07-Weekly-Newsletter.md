Evening,

Some quick updates for the week. We have a fairly busy schedule this upcoming
week so let me go through the upcoming events.

We have the usual COSI meeting this Wednesday. In preparation for the 7 Hour
Roguelike this Saturday, Corey Richardson will be offering a workshop on some
tips and tricks to prepare for the event this Thursday at 6pm. Speaking of the
7HRL, We are having it this Saturday from 12pm-7pm in the ITL. I've
participated in the last two and I highly encourage people to attend. Finally,
I will be holding the 2nd meeting for COSI Webdev this Sunday. I'm going to try
the 10:30am start time again this week, but if those who wish to attend would
like another time, feel free to reply to me.

That is a lot of content, so I am planning on putting all of the dates and times
for these events somewhere on the whiteboard so people can keep track of all the
events.

Finally, I would like to formally announce the 2nd Hack Potsdam. The Potsdam ACM
and COSI will be joining up to host it this upcoming semester here at Clarkson,
so stay tuned to a email later this week discussing more details on it.

Have a good week!
Benjamin
