## Budget
People brought a large number of items to debate: VM Host ($3500), Filament ($25 / spool), Label Tape ($100), Ethernet Crimps ($50), HRC Vive ($1200), Monitors ($600-$1200). COSI currently has about $5358 ($1918 
after VM Host). We've approved Label Tape, Ethernet Crimps, 10 Monitors, The VM Host, and Filament (3 spools?). We also thought about getting some books? We'll finish off the budget during the summer.

## Home Directory Backup
Ben wants to back up home directories. We are debating how we will do so but agree that we will do it.

## New VM Host
The lab is fine with Adam's proposed host.
